DESCRIPTION  :  This project implements a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam (ham). Using the Naive Bayes classifier and Scikit-learn, the model is trained on a publicly available dataset of labeled SMS messages. The text data is transformed into numerical features using CountVectorizer (bag-of-words technique). The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix to ensure reliable spam detection.
